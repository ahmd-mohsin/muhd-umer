- 👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad Umer, an undergrad student at National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST)
- 👀 I’m interested in a broad variety of things, however, to pin it down, I would say I'm most fantasized by Deep Learning, and especially, Computer Vision
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and familiarizing myself with state-of-the-art Machine Learning models and researches, in hopes to make such advancements in the future myself (●'◡'●)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYTHING \^o^/
